                <p>
                  Established in 2014, Simpli5 Design Studio began as a small team of passionate 
                  designers with a shared vision: to create spaces that not only look beautiful 
                  but truly enhance the way people live, work, and interact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, we've grown into a full-service design studio, but we've never 
                  lost sight of what makes us unique â€“ our commitment to understanding each client's 
                  individual needs and translating them into spaces that reflect their personality 
                  and lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we're proud to have completed over 150 projects, from intimate residential 
                  spaces to large commercial developments. Each project is a testament to our belief 
                  that thoughtful design has the power to transform lives and communities.
